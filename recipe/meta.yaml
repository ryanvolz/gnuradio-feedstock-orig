  summary: 'The free and open software radio ecosystem'
  description: |
    GNU Radio is a free software development toolkit that provides the signal
    processing runtime and processing blocks to implement software radios using
    readily-available, low-cost external RF hardware and commodity processors.
    It is widely used in hobbyist, academic and commercial environments to
    support wireless communications research as well as to implement real-world
    radio systems.

    GNU Radio applications are primarily written using the Python programming
    language, while the supplied, performance-critical signal processing path
    is implemented in C++ using processor floating point extensions where
    available. Thus, the developer is able to implement real-time, high-
    throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development
    environment.
